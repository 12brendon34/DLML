The way I did DX rendering is not very good and generally needs to be rewritten.

# Instructions
This mod hijacks dsound.dll, so you must drag the one provided into your DL folder (with replacement, if needed)
![dll location](https://github.com/12brendon34/DLML/assets/43822289/a739b1f4-83cd-4416-b1b2-f2a7c74308b1)\
To load a pak, you need to place it under "Dying Light\CustomPaks". If this does not exist, it will be created\
You can check if you have done everything right by pressing f5 in-game and seeing if there is a log entry for your mod.
